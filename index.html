                    <p>In the future, I'd like to have under my belt two bachelor's: in accounting and in computer science. Building a network and making meaningful connections add momentum to the pursuit of a life well-lived, so I enjoy talking to people and hearing their stories.</p>
                    <!-- e.g. I love building websites, and learning to code! -->
                    <p>I've seen untold beauty across the Pacific Ocean. Much of my childhood was spent in a village in the middle of the jungle.</p>
                    <!-- e.g. I spent my weekends in the mountains hiking with my friends. -->

                        <p class="indent_p">The GitHub repo is private due to the sensitivity of the contained data. It used an Ubuntu Server for backend file management, RDBMS hosting, and an Apache instance, all in Docker containers to serve an interactive front-end for a non-profit called CCAEJ. This project was spearheaded by the wonderful Yvette Vargas, a UCI-graduate that is currently studying at UC Berkeley.</p>

                        <p class="indent_p">This is an audio/visual label that sought to unite, enhance, and promote artists with minds and tastes aligned with mine and my friend's. It features three main "Nomads", us included, and showcases the arts of impressive individuals that caught our fancy. The aim: "to push into reality anything that tells a story."</p>
