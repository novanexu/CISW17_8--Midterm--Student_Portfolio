	- Database Project: CCAEJ with Rylan and Yvette
		- Desc: The GitHub repo is private due to the sensitivity of the contained data. It used an Ubuntu Server for backend file management, RDBMS hosting, and an Apache instance, all in Docker containers to serve an interactive front-end for a non-profit called CCAEJ. This project was spearheaded by the wonderful Yvette Vargas, a UCI-graduate that is currently studying at UC Berkeley.

	- Collaborative Project: Painted Nomads (Music Collective)
		- Desc: This is an audio/visual label that sought to unite, enhance, and promote artists with minds and tastes aligned with mine and my friend's. It features three main "Nomads", us included, and showcases the arts of impressive individuals that caught our fancy. The aim: "to push into reality anything that tells a story."

	- Bedroom Producer Project: RoTa
		- Desc: My alias is rommyRoTa. It used to be just RoTa. Since I have less than a few hundred followers, I might change the alias again, since it's a little undecided. But here's a my repository of music. Been producing since 6th grade.
